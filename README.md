📒** Notebook Contents (presentation.ipynb)**

Data Overview & Initial Checks – schema sanity, distributions, missingness.

Data Cleaning – imputation, rare-category handling, standardization.

Feature Engineering – time/age/usage features (e.g., SaleYear, AgeYears, HoursPerYear).

Baseline & Pipeline – preprocessing (Impute/Encode) → Random Forest.

Evaluation – RMSE/MAE, residual plots, price‑by‑year boxplots.

Next Steps – ideas for tuning and richer features.
